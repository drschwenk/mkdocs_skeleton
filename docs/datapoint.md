# Some data point
The level of hierarchy used in creating a single page is a decision that will depend on the dataset, and
should reflect its organization. This is largely a trade-off between the number of pages and length of a 
single page needed, with some consideration for the difficulty in generating markdown pages from the dataset.
## Component 1
Subheadings will be used to generated an intra-page navigation menu, and can help keep larger pages manageable.
## Component 2
At present, the theme can only handle two levels of hierarchy.
